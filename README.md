  # How do I approach designing software?
    What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
        I learned a lot in this course, I think in the beginning a lot of my work and assignments had extra lines of code or other things that made it more confusing when trying to parse through it again. One thing that I learned was a new way to use vertexes and how to expand on how they can be used to create multiple objects.
    
     What design process did you follow for your project work?
        What I did to design during this course was to understand what was expected of me by reviewing the requirements and making sure that I incorporated those into my final project.
        
    How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
      I think what I did can be applied to all projects or assignments because when I fully understand what I need to do and what is required of me I can better complete any projects or assignments.
        
  # How do I approach developing programs?
    What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
    I think when developing a 3D scene I had to look into the way to make one which was helped along with the milestones and the tutorials we were given during this span of this course, which let me understand this better.
    
    How did iteration factor into your development?
       I think with the iteration that happened during this course we started by making a simple rendition of our final scene and building on that slowly and progressing to eventually build the final scene.
       
    How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
    I think this was a hugely important part of my development and understanding of OpenGL and made it easier to understand new concepts every week by not only applying them to a simple assignment but also by applying them to our milestones which made sure that we understood what was taught during the lesson that week.
    
# How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
    How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
      I think that they expanded my overall understanding of the C++ programming language and also helped me to understand better coding practices to make it more clear and concise to be readable by those who didn't make the code themselves, These skills will prove valuable as I continue to learn more coding practices and more coding languages.
      
    How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
      Sort of like I said above this has helped me to understand and use what I learned during this course which can help me in my development of further projects and can also help me in the future of my jobs or professional life as my understanding of what I need to do during development can make my overall development of a project more accurate and more timely.
