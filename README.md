# CS-330: Computer Graphics and Visualization

## Overview

This repository contains coursework and projects completed for the CS-330: Computer Graphics and Visualization course at Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU). The project demonstrates proficiency in 3D graphics programming using OpenGL and related technologies. The primary objective was to develop an interactive 3D scene incorporating various computer graphics principles.

## Project Features

- **3D Object Creation**: Used vertices to construct multiple complex objects within the scene.
- **Texture Mapping**: Applied textures such as wood, paper, pencil, keyboard, and mouse images to enhance realism.
- **Lighting and Shading**: Implemented lighting techniques to add depth and realism.
- **Camera Controls**: Developed interactive camera movements for different scene perspectives.

## Software Design Approach

### Designing Software Effectively

Designing software begins with a clear understanding of project requirements. By breaking down complex tasks into smaller components and systematically implementing them, the development process becomes more structured and efficient.

### Key Design Skills Developed

- **Code Optimization**: Early on, my code contained redundant lines, making it harder to maintain. Through this project, I learned to write cleaner and more efficient code.
- **Advanced Vertex Usage**: I expanded my knowledge of how vertices can be manipulated to create multiple objects within a 3D scene.

### Design Process Followed

1. **Understanding Requirements**: Carefully reviewed project specifications to ensure all elements were incorporated.
2. **Incremental Development**: Built a simple version of the final scene first and progressively enhanced it.
3. **Iterative Refinement**: Continuously improved the project through feedback and testing.
4. **Code Organization**: Structured the project for better readability and maintainability.

### Applying Design Strategies to Future Work

The structured approach used in this project can be applied to future assignments and projects. By clearly defining objectives, breaking down tasks, and iterating on improvements, any software development process becomes more manageable and effective.

## Software Development Approach

### New Development Strategies Used

- **Research-Driven Learning**: I explored best practices for 3D scene development, leveraging milestones and tutorials provided in the course.
- **Incremental Scene Construction**: Started with a basic scene and iteratively expanded it, ensuring a strong foundation before adding complexity.

### Role of Iteration in Development

Iteration played a crucial role in refining my project. Each milestone required building upon the previous version, gradually enhancing the scene until the final product was complete.

### Evolution of Development Approach

Throughout the course, my approach to developing code evolved significantly. Early milestones introduced fundamental concepts, which were reinforced through assignments and progressively applied to the final project. This iterative learning process improved my understanding of OpenGL and strengthened my coding skills.

## Impact of Computational Graphics on My Goals

### Educational Growth

Working on this project deepened my understanding of the C++ programming language and improved my ability to write clear, maintainable code. These skills will be beneficial as I continue learning more programming languages and refining my coding practices.

### Professional Applications

The knowledge and experience gained from this project will be valuable in my future career. Understanding computational graphics and visualization techniques will allow me to develop more efficient and visually appealing applications. Additionally, the ability to break down complex projects into manageable components will be an essential skill in any professional software development role.
